Description: 
    A lightweight, dependency-free tool designed to facilitate statistical 
    simulations through functional programming. It centralizes the simulation process into a single 
    higher-order function, enhancing manageability and usability without adding overhead from external 
    dependencies. The package includes ready-to-use functions for common simulation targets and processes. A detailed example can be found on <https://github.com/ielbadisy/mcstatsim>.
